I am a Research Director at [Crime Lab New York](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/crime-new-york), a University of Chicago research institute that partners with civic and community leaders in New York City to design, test, and scale promising programs and policies to reduce crime and violence. I finished my Ph.D. in Computer Science at New York Universityâ€™s Tandon School of Engineering in January 2017. My advisers were Keith W. Ross and Bruce Kogut. I develop and evaluate the impact of prediction models on outcomes in the areas of domestic violence, gun violence, and child safety. I also study the science production function, specifically the incentives that drive how research is presented.
