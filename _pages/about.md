I am an Assistant Professor at the iSchool as well as the Criminology and Criminal Justice department at the University of Maryland. I was previously a Research Director at [Crime Lab New York](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/crime-new-york), a University of Chicago research institute that partners with civic and community leaders in New York City and New Jersey to design, test, and scale promising programs and policies to reduce crime and violence. I finished my Ph.D. in Computer Science at New York Universityâ€™s Tandon School of Engineering in January 2017. I develop and evaluate the impact of prediction models on outcomes in the areas of domestic violence, gun violence, and child safety. I also study the science production function, specifically the incentives that drive how research is presented.
